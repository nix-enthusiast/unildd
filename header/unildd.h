 * - \>0: Magic number of the unknown object (as `i64` (or `Ã¬nt64_t))
 * - -1: Binary is corrupted
 * - -2: Unknown/Bad magic number
 * - -3: Error at reading and interpreting bytes
 * - -4: I/O Error at parsing the object
 * - -5: Buffer is too short to hold
 * - -6: Unknown error[^1]
 * - -7: Unimplemented executable format
 *
 * [^1]: All errors thrown by goblin crate and my code are covered. Because of matching goblin's [`Error`](goblin::error::Error) is non-exhaustive, I included non-exhaustive path too.
